# Thai Students in Ireland - Study in Ireland information

The <https://github.com/thaisocireland/docs> repository on GitHub
hosts the website available at
<https://thaisocireland.github.io/docs>.

The website offers Thai-language information on Irish higher education for
prospective students.

In the Git repository:

- `main` branch hosts source files, meant to be input files for
  [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- `gh-pages` branch hosts generated HTML files for the website

New content and amendments are always welcome.
Please open
[an issue asking for changes](https://github.com/thaisocireland/docs/issues)
or
[a pull request proposing changes](https://github.com/thaisocireland/docs/pulls).

You can also edit a file in `docs/` directory
on the Git repository directly
(which will effectively open a pull request to change that file).
The content is in
[Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

If new files are added, they should also be added to the `nav` section in
`mkdocs.yml` if you want them to appear in the website navigation bar.
